	* >4.1, BUG: add installation support for IRIX and Ultrix

	* >4.1, BUG: 'pack' exits with 'Chf initialization failed'
	if setlocale() fails during Chf initialization; apply the same
	patch as 'saturn'.
	Reported by Julian Einwag <julian@brightstar.swin.de>
	
	* >4.1, BUG: Bad interaction with 'Emulate3Buttons' option
	of XFree86; need key memory or key dispatch delay.

	* >3.17: with HP49 ROM 1.19-4, command-line activity
	results in a lot of late hits during unconfig.  Investigate
	why, in this case, late hits do not result in immediate hits
	in subsequent unconfigs.

	* >3.17, Saturn.ad, BUG: some X Terminals, e.g. VXT2000,
	don't have an Escape key; the existing conventions,
	e.g. F11 for Escape on VXT2000, conflicts with the
	existing shortcuts.

	* >3.17, Saturn.ad, BUG: some X Terminals, e.g. VXT2000, only have a
	Delete (*not* BackSpace) key; make sure that backspace shortcut
	is available anyway in baseTranslations.

	* >3.15, BUG: xmodem file transfers don't work with

	* >3.15, serial.c: Implement hangup on exit on pty;
	kermit insists that 'A serial connection might still be active'
	even when the emulator is no longer running.
	(Possibly not a bug)

	(Implemented in 3.16)

	* >=3.15, Imakefile, Ultrix: EXTRA_TAIL_LIBRARIES = -li

	(Fixed in 3.16; tested on already supported platforms and Ultrix)
		
	* >=3.15, Saturn.ad, Ultrix: Keypad's numeric keys don't work;
	they work removing the leading ':' specifier
	(Fixed in 3.16, both code and documentation; tested on all platforms)
