To get started with the saturn software, follow these steps:

- If you have an user-level binary distribution, read the file
  BUILD_INFO.txt and check that the platform on which the
  saturn software was built is compatible with yours.

- If you have a source distribution, follow the instructions
  of INSTALL.txt to build the binaries and, optionally,
  to install them.

- Read the documentation of the saturn software, above all chapter 2.
  You must build the documentation yourself as explained in INSTALL.txt
  if you have a source distribution; instead, if you have a binary
  distribution, both info and PostScript files are already there.

- If you are in a real hurry and wish to emulate an HP49 as soon
  as possible, run the ./quick_start shell script.
