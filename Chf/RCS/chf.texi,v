@@cindex Win32 Support

The Condition Handling facility library 
provides a centralized, unified method of generating and
signaling exceptional conditions.  This method can be used either in
conjunction with, or in alternative to, the traditional style of handling
error conditions by returning distinguished error values when an error
occurs in a procedure, and checking for these values after each procedure
invocation.

It serves many different purposes:

@@itemize @@bullet

@@item
It helps to gather and make available as much information as possible when
an error occurs, such as which source module detected it, its severity,
and any other ancillary information the user may find useful.

@@item
It provides an unified method to log and print error messages, and to
internationalize applications.

@@item
By means of condition handlers, it gives the user a convenient way to
implement global exception recovery actions in an application.

@@item
It may improve the readability of the source code, because less explicit
checks for error conditions are required.

@@end itemize

Since release @@code{2.2}, the Chf library also supports Unicode-based Win32
systems, notably Windows CE.  Implementation details of the Win32 version
of the library will be discussed in the documentation, and will be
highlighted by the @@strong{Win32} keyword.  Moreover, the following
general notes apply:

@@itemize @@bullet

@@item
All library functions, when compiled for Win32, handle Unicode
character strings (array of @@code{TCHAR}) instead of ASCII strings
(array of @@code{char}); this change is transparent and the documentation
does not reflect it.

@@item
Library functions @@code{sigsetjmp()} and @@code{siglongjmp()} are not
supported; accordingly, they are replaced by
@@code{setjmp()} and @@code{longjmp()}.  The non-local control transfer
context buffer, @@code{sigjmp_buf} is also replaced by @@code{jmp_buf};
this change is transparent and the documentation does not reflect it.

@@item
The reentrant flavor of the Chf library is not yet supported.  Multithreaded
application must serialize Chf accesses themselves.

@@item
The @@code{ChfErrnoCondition} macro is not supported, and has no effect.

@@item
The default condition handler does not display the condition message
on the standard error stream.

@@item
The @@code{CHF_ABORT} initialization flag is not fully supported;
when used, the Chf library invokes @@code{exit(EXIT_FAILURE)}
instead of @@code{abort()} (not supported by Win32) to abort the application.

@@end itemize

The following terms will be used often throughout this document:

@@table @@code
@@item Exception
@@cindex Exception
An @@dfn{exception} is an event that changes the normal flow of instruction
execution, and is usually caused by an error condition.  Any procedure can
generate an exception using the @@code{ChfGenerate} macro, and then
raise or signal it using the @@code{ChfSignal()} function call.

@@item Condition
@@cindex Condition
An informational state which exists when an exception occurs, and encloses
information about the exception itself.  The term @@dfn{condition} is preferred,
since the term exception usually implies an error.

@@item Condition handling
@@cindex Condition handling
When a condition is detected during the execution of a procedure, the
procedure can signal the condition.  The
hierarchy of currently active condition handlers is then permitted to
respond to the condition; the procedure response is called
@@dfn{condition handling}.

The condition handlers are themselves procedures and they are called
with the usual calling conventions; the only exception is that, in the
current release of the Chf library, they cannot establish condition
handlers of their own.

A procedure can establish a condition handler using the function
@@code{ChfPushHandler()}, that pushes a new condition handler on top of
a LIFO handler stack; the condition handler stays active until a
matching call to @@code{ChfPopHandler()}, that pops the topmost handler
from the handler stack is executed, or until an execution stack
unwind occurs.

Another way to implicitly establishing and removing condition handlers
is to use the structured condition handling macros.
@@xref{Structured condition handling}, for more information.

@@node Initialization and exit, Condition generation and signal, Overview, Top
@@chapter Initialization and exit
@@cindex Initialization and exit
@@cindex Initialization
@@cindex Exit

Before using any function of the Chf library, it must be correctly
initialized.  Since the library has a generic interface towards the
message retrieval subsystem (@@pxref{Message retrieval}),
more than one initialization function exist, one each for every message
retrieval subsystem the library supports, plus one custom initialization
function to use if a custom message retrieval subsystem is used.
After initialization, the library accesses the message retrieval subsystem
transparently, and its peculiarities are no longer visible to the users.

All initialization functions, when successful, register a default condition
handler. @@xref{Default handler}.

Moreover, each module using the Chf library must include the header file
@@code{Chf.h} and provide some basic definitions. @@xref{Library header}.

This function initializes the Chf library using a custom message retrieval
subsystem, and returns to the caller a condition code; that code will be either
@@code{CHF_S_OK} if the initialization was successful, or one of the other
values listed below.

Arguments:

@@table @@code
@@item app_name
is the name of the application. It can be used by condition
handlers to print out error messages.

@@item options
is the bitwise or of the following option identifiers:

@@table @@code

@@item CHF_DEFAULT
Represents the default value for all options.

@@item CHF_ABORT
If this flag is set, the Chf library will use @@code{abort()} instead of
either @@code{exit(exit_code)} or @@code{pthread_exit(exit_code)} to abort
the application when an unrecoverable exception occurs.  This forces a
core dump that may be useful for debugging purposes.

@@strong{Win32:} This flag is not fully supported; the Chf library

Private data pointer for the custom message retrieval subsystem.

@@item mrs_get
Message retrieval subsystem's 'Get Message' function.

@@item mrs_exit
Message retrieval subsystem's 'Exit' function.

@@item condition_stack_size
Size of the condition stack.  This value determines the maximum number of
pending conditions, i.e. conditions that have been generated but have
not been signaled yet.  A condition that is being signaled is
still pending until the signaling sequence completes.

@@item handler_stack_size
Size of the handler stack.  This value determines the maximum number of
active condition handlers the application can have.  A condition handler is
activated when a @@code{ChfPushHandler()} is executed for it, and it is
deactivated when the corresponding @@code{ChfPopHandler()} completes.
In addition, each execution of the @@code{ChfTry} macro also pushes
a condition handler; the handler is removed when @@code{ChfEndTry}
is executed.

@@item exit_code
This is the exit code the Chf library will use to exit either the
application or the offending thread when an unrecoverable exception
occurs.

An error occurred and the application's module was not able to complete its

@@item CHF_FATAL
A fatal error occurred, and a global recovery action is required, because
the normal application's control flow can't be safely resumed. The Chf library

During the signaling of a condition group the following actions are

First of all, a check is made to ensure that the Chf subsystem has been
correctly initialized.  If not, the function @@code{ChfAbort} is called.

The state of Chf is changed to @@code{CHF_SIGNALING} if it was @@code{CHF_IDLE},

If there is not any active condition group, the function does nothing more,
restores the saved Chf state and returns to the caller.
@@item
If there is an active condition group, the currently active condition handlers
are invoked, starting from the one registered last.
@@item
Each condition handler can recursively invoke @@code{ChfGenerate()} and
@@code{ChfSignal()}. @@code{ChfGenerate()}, when invoked, will create a new
condition group, and @@code{ChfSignal()} will signal the condition group
just created.
@@item
When the Chf state is @@code{CHF_SIGNALING}, any new condition group generated
but not yet signaled when the current handler exits is merged
with the condition group currently being signaled, in order to allow
the condition handlers to add their own conditions to the condition
group. If the severity of the previous condition group was @@code{CHF_FATAL},
the severity of the new group is forced to @@code{CHF_FATAL}, too.
When the Chf state is @@code{CHF_UNWINDING}, the condition group for
which the unwind has been requested is 'frozen', no further
modifications are allowed on it, and the new condition group is simply
discarded.
@@item
The condition handlers calling sequence terminates when either the handler
stack is exhausted (all condition handlers have been called) or when an
handler requests either the action @@code{CHF_CONTINUE},
@@code{CHF_UNWIND} or @@code{CHF_UNWIND_KEEP}.
Please note that the @@code{CHF_CONTINUE} action cannot be requested if
the severity of the condition group is @@code{CHF_FATAL}; when this occurs,
the action is automatically changed to @@code{CHF_RESIGNAL} instead.
@@item
If the action @@code{CHF_CONTINUE} has been requested and it is allowed, Chf
discards the current condition group, restored the saved Chf state and
returns to the instruction following the call to @@code{ChfSignal()}, that
started the signaling activities.
@@item
If either one of the actions @@code{CHF_UNWIND} or @@code{CHF_UNWIND_KEEP}
has been requested and it is allowed, that is,
no other unwinds are already in progress, the current Chf state is set
to @@code{CHF_UNWINDING} and all handlers that were registered
after the handler that requested the unwind are called again, starting
from the one registered last, so that they can perform any final cleanup
operation they require for proper operation. The handler that requested
the unwind is called again, too, in the same fashion.  Immediately after
this, the unwinded condition handlers are removed from the handler stack
and discarded, the current condition group and any other group generated
after it are destroyed, the Chf state is changed back to @@code{CHF_IDLE}
and a non-local control transfer is executed through a
@@code{siglongjmp()}, using the @@code{unwind_context} associated with the
handler that requested the unwind as target.  The @@code{ChfSignal()}
invocation that started the signaling activities will never return to
the caller.  If the requested action is @@code{CHF_UNWIND_KEEP} everything
goes as described above, except that the current condition group and
any other group generated after it are @@strong{not} destroyed, so they can
still be accessed after the non-local control transfer has taken place.
@@item
If no handlers were able to handle the condition, the invoking
application/thread is terminated with @@code{ChfAbort()}.
@@item
If an handler returned an invalid action code and it is not the condition
handler that was registered first, a new condition group is generated and
immediately signaled, containing the condition @@code{CHF_F_INVALID_ACTION}

@@end table

The handler must return an action code, represented by a value
of type @@code{ChfAction}.

Before returning, the condition handler can generate other conditions,
without signaling them, with the purpose of better specify the current
condition group; these conditions will be added on top of the current
group when the handler returns.  The next handler, if any, will be invoked
on the updated condition group.

The severity @@code{CHF_FATAL} is 'sticky', that is, any new condition
linked to a condition group where the topmost condition has that
severity will be forced to the same severity level.

If the condition handler itself generates and signals a new condition
group, its superior condition handlers will be invoked on the new
condition group only. When the new signaling sequence is completed,
the old sequence will be resumed if appropriate, i.e. if a superior
handler has requested the @@code{CHF_CONTINUE} action and the severity
of the new condition group allows it to do so.

Above, @@code{<<} and @@code{>>} mark the starting and ending point of
each macro expansion, respectively.

The @@code{body} is either a statement or a block of statements (a block
is shown in the example) to be protected.  If an exception with severity
equal to @@code{CHF_FATAL} is signaled during the execution of
@@code{body}, control is transferred to the @@code{condition handler}
following @@code{ChfCatch}.

The handler can then retrieve the condition group associated with the
exception using @@code{ChfGetTopCondition()}, as shown in the example,
and must perform one of the following actions:

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
Handle the exception; when the condition handler completes, that is, its
last statement has been executed, the current condition group is
automatically discarded and control is transferred to the code that
follows @@code{ChfEndTry}.
@@item
Resignal the exception, possibly after adding one or more conditions to
it; in this case, the handler explicitly calls @@code{ChfSignal()}.
In response, Chf continues to search for a handler that actually
handles the exception, in the @@code{ChfTry}/@@code{ChfCatch} blocks
enclosing the current one, in inner to outer order.  The control
will never be returned to the resignaling handler.
@@end itemize

Notice that it is not possible for the condition handler to resume
the thread of execution disrupted by the exception. Resuming is
possible only when the signaled condition has severity less than
@@code{CHF_FATAL}: in this case the @@code{condition handler} is
not invoked, the usual condition signaling sequence takes place
and the @@code{CHF_CONTINUE} action requested by any general
condition handler is honored.

Thus, structured condition handling is further simplified because:

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
Conditions with severity less than @@code{CHF_WARNING} are usually
automatically signaled immediately after generation and are not reported
to the caller; they are informational conditions only, and they must not
disrupt the normal control flow of the application.  Accordingly, the
structured condition handler is @@strong{not} invoked when a
success/informational condition is signaled in its @@code{ChfTry} body.
@@item
@@code{CHF_WARNING} conditions generated by a module are usually not
signaled immediately after generation, but are reported to the
caller using some status reporting mechanism.  When a warning
condition is generated by a module, it indicates that its execution
has been at least partially successful; this usually means that
the disruption of the control flow of the application can be kept to
a minimum and handled locally.  Accordingly, the structured condition
handler is @@strong{not} invoked when a warning condition
is signaled in its @@code{ChfTry} body.
@@item
@@code{CHF_ERROR} conditions generated by a module indicate that the
module execution has been unsuccessful; they are usually reported to the
caller using some status reporting mechanisms.  An error condition
indicates that a significant disruption of the control flow of the
application is required to recover, and that local handling is still
possible but could not suffice.  Accordingly, the structured condition
handler is @@strong{not} invoked when an error condition is signaled in
its @@code{ChfTry} body.  Notice also that if the @@code{ChfTry} body is
not able to locally recover the condition, it can add a @@code{CHF_FATAL}
condition to the condition group and signal the modified group, thus
triggering the invocation of the structured condition handler.
@@item
@@code{CHF_FATAL} conditions are usually signaled immediately after
generation and always require a global recovery action.
Accordingly, the structured condition handler is
invoked when a warning condition is signaled in its @@code{ChfTry} body.
@@end itemize

Notice also that control is transferred to the structured exception
handler by means of a @@code{siglongjmp()} sequence.  Therefore,
if the structured exception handler needs to access automatic
variables, they should be declared @@code{volatile}.

If no handlers are able to handle an exception, the default Chf
condition handler is invoked last. @@xref{Default handler}, for a more
detailed description of its operation.

If no exceptions are raised during the execution of @@code{body},
the @@code{condition handler} is skipped and execution continues

The message retrieval subsystem is responsible to retrieve the message
fragments needed by the Chf library to generate the messages associated
with condition codes.

Basically, given a message set identifier (that usually has the same value
as the module identifier for which the condition is being generated) and
a message number (that usually has the same value as the condition code),
it must retrieve and return to the caller a suitable message associated
to it. It the message cannot be found, it must return a default message
pointer Chf provides.

Some module identifiers/message sets are used for special purposes.

@@chapter Multithreading support
@@cindex Multithreading support

When compiled appropriately, the Chf library supports multithreading,
and maintains one Chf context per active thread.  Multithreading support
is enabled when the cpp macro @@code{_REENTRANT} is defined.

@@strong{Win32:}  Multitreading support is not provided yet.

When multithreading support is enabled, the following modifications
to the default Chf behavior come into effect:

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
@@code{ChfInit()} no longer initializes the condition stack, the
condition handler stack and the message buffer immediately; instead, one
copy of these context elements will be allocated for each active thread
in the application, when it first invokes any other Chf function.
Also, per-thread Chf contexts are dynamically destroyed when the
owning thread terminates.
@@item
Condition generation and both general and structured condition handling
work as before inside each application's thread. All threads share the
same values for @@code{condition_stack_size}, @@code{handler_stack_size}
and @@code{exit_code}, but are otherwise fully independent with
respect to condition handling, because each of them has a private
Chf context.
@@item
@@code{ChfAbort()} no longer exits the whole application when
the @@code{CHF_ABORT} Chf flag not set; instead, it exits the
invoking thread only.
@@item
Almost all Chf functions can trigger the @@code{CHF_ABORT_GET_CONTEXT}
and @@code{CHF_ABORT_PTHREAD} aborts, if they fail to correctly
manage dynamic Chf context creation and/or @@code{pthread} interactions.
@@item
All Chf functions, except @@code{ChfInit()} and @@code{ChfExit()}
no longer check whether Chf has been correctly initialized or not:
that check would have been too time-consuming in a multithreaded environment.
As a consequence, invoking a Chf function when Chf has not been correctly
initialized has unpredictable effects instead of neatly aborting
the application with abort code @@code{CHF_ABORT_INIT}.
@@item
The performance of the Chf condition generation and signaling functions
is likely to decrease, because Chf must retrieve its per-thread context
dynamically instead of referring to a static storage area.
