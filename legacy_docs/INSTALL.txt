To build saturn from the source distribution, follow these steps:

0) Create an empty directory, and unpack the source distribution archive
   into it, for example:

   $ mkdir build_dir
   $ cd build_dir
   $ gunzip < ../saturn_src_V4_1.tar.gz | tar xf - .

   If you are reading this notice, you probably have already done this...


1) Generate the platform-specific Makefile:

   $ xmkmf

   On Solaris platforms, if gcc is your default (or only) compiler,
   you may need to force its selection, using the following
   command instead of xmkmf:

   $ imake -DUseInstalled -DHasGcc -I/usr/openwin/lib/X11/config


2) Generate module dependencies:

   $ make depend


3) Build saturn:

   $ make


4) Build the documentation.
   You need a working Texinfo system to do this:

   $ make doc


5) Optionally, install saturn systemwide (you need root privileges
   to do this):

   $ make install


6) Enjoy
